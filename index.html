				<h2>Matthew Bird's Personal Info</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Matthew Bird and I am an Australian with an Irish/Polish background who goes to RMIT. My student ID is s3482450 and my student email is s3482450@student.rmit.edu.au and I speak only English. Interesting facts about myself is that I play and taught myself guitar, as well as I own a fair number of guitars. I also do music and audio production work for other artists, performing mixing and mastering to improve their music. And finally, I once saw a chicken on the way to school. It ran past me and flew over several houses. That was the day I learned chickens are capable of short distance flight. So basically, the movie chicken run is a lie. All the chickens could have just flown over the fence.</p>

				<h2>Rahal Abeyrathna’s Personal Info</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Rahal Abeyrathna and I am 18, turning 19 this May. My student code is s3781696 and email is s3781696@student.rmit.edu.au My nationality is Sri Lankan however I was born in Australia on May 10th, 2000 and I am actually really bad at speaking Sinhalese. Prior to RMIT, I went to Glen Waverley Secondary College and studied Further Maths, English Language, Psychology, Software Development and Media. I also did a traineeship for a company called Lightmare Studios which counted as my 6th subject while also getting paid! As for my interesting fact, I recently got a pet bird, her name is Luma (no, not Luna) and she is a Green Cheek Conure. She is such a sweetheart but also the biggest brat as she constantly needs your attention. In my spare time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos, listening to music and the occasional nap. I also like playing games, but I don't find myself having as much time to play lately..</p>

Here is one interesting fact about how I am crazy about games recently, which is that I finished the game Sekiro, the new game from FromSoftware for all endings just three days after it released.</p>

				<h2>Group Processes</h>
				</header>
				<p> With the 2nd Assignment, our group had communicated either through the tutorial classes that we shared together, or via 'What's App' if we needed anything and we weren't able to attend the tutorial classes. As for sharing our files and progress of the assignment, we had used a shared Google Drive, to send and work for our assignment. For Assignment 3, we have stuck to the same processes as before, as we found that it works best with our group. </p>
